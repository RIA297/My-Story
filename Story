                           The Mountain and the Mouse
One day there was a battle of wits between a mouse and a mountain.
 The mountain said, "What a poor thing you are!"
The mouse snapped, "I know I am not as big as you are. But, then, you are not as small as I am."
"Big size has big advantages," said the mountain, "I can stop the clouds sailing across the sky."
"So you can," agreed the mouse. "But you can't stop me from making big holes in your very foundation, can you ?"
The tiny mouse outwitted the mighty mountain.
Moral :- BIG OR SMALL, EACH ONE HAS HIS IMPORTANCE.
